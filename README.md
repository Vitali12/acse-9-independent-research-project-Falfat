# Introduction

This work proposes an easy to use, open sourced library, Y-Frac, for DFN modelling and analysis. Y-Frac is built upon the python APIs available on Rhinoceros 6. Hence, Y-Frac is fit for use on Rhinoceros software package. Y-Frac can model fracture networks containing circular, elliptical and regular polygonal fractures. This library is computationally cheap for DFN modelling and analysis. Some of the functionalities of this library for DFN analysis include fracture intersection analysis, cut-plane analysis, and percolation analysis. The output text file from this library containing modelled fracture networksâ€™ parameters can serve as input for appropriate software packages to simulate flow and perform mechanical analysis in fracture networks.

# Requirements
This library expands on Rhiniceros (Rhino) 6 python API. Hence, users need to install the software before using this library.

- Rhinoceros 6 for windows, can be donloaded [here](https://www.rhino3d.com/download)
- Rhinoceros 6 for windows hardware requirements can be found [here](https://www.rhino3d.com/6/system_requirements)
- Rhinoceros 6 python API documentation can be found [here](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/) 
- Users can look up Rhino [user guide](http://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/6/usersguide/en-us/index.htm)
- matplotlib >= 3.0.2 for postprocessing

# Installation
- Clone this repository to your computer using the following on the command line.

`git clone http://github.com/msc-acse/acse-9-independent-research-project-Falfat.git`

- The contents in the file should be copied to the Rhinoceros 6 script folder for use, as described below

`~\McNeel\Rhinoceros\6.0\scripts`

# Usage
- Once the files are in the Rhino's script folder. Users should open the Rhino software and maneuver to the Rhino python scripting platform, described as follows

` Tools >> PythonScript >> Edit `

![Rhino](./images/Rhino.PNG)

- A second interface will pop up for python scripting. Users can then access the Rhinopython script folder by clicking

`File >> Open >> ~\McNeel\Rhinoceros\6.0\scripts`

- A new file can then be open to access the Y-Frac modules saved in the Y-Frac folder. To open a new Rhino python scripting file:

`File >> New..`

- The Rhino python scripting platform does not support matplotlib package for visualisations. Therefore, the postprocesing module `PostProcessing.py` should be used on a IDE that supports matplotlib.

- The `input_file` folder contains two text files that to specify fracture parameters and statistical distribution for the library. It is advisable that these files should be copied to the Y-Frac folder for easy access by the modules. The instructions on how to fill these text files is contained in the files.

- Y-Frac outputs a text file which contains domain size, fracture_shape, fracture orienations, planes and sizes for fracture regeneration and input to more complex software packages for flow simulation and geomechanical anlysis of fracture networks.

- The `percolation_analysis` and `analysis_script` folders contain some DFN analysis done with Y-Frac. Each of the file is well commented to describe the analysis contained in it. Basically, these folders and the test folder, `test_scripts` should be unbundled into the `Y-Frac` folder which conatins the modules. The `test_scripts` contains some files to test the functionalities of the methods in this library.

- The `text_files` folder contain is where the output file named `fracture_data` is written. It also contains some text files used for analysis to demonstrated Y-Frac's functionalities. Again, it is prefered this folder be copied into `Y-Frac` folder for easy accessibility.

- Users should endeavor to change `paths` of text files where required.

## Example: Generating fixed number of fractures
```python
# create an instance of domain
dom = Domain.Domain(boxlength) 

# draw domain
#dom.Show() 

# insert 50 fractures in the domain
frac_list = DFN_Gen.FixedFractureGen(50,aspect_ratio=2, sides =5)

# trim out of bounds fractures
dom.RemoveSurfacesOutsideOfBox(dom.length)
```


# Documentation
- Full documentation is available in `Y-Frac.html` in `documentation` file.

- Below is the architecture of Y-Frac's library. *The names of modules, methods and functions are intuitive.*
